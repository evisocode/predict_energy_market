# Rules and Context

Authorized ENTITIES can submit BIDs to try to purchase or sell energy in the SPOT MARKET.

The SPOT MARKET represents the reservation of energy. No real energy is exchanged here.
The difference between the real energy produced or consumed by each entity and the energy reserved in SPOT MARKET will be handled by the DISPATCH MARKET that will charge entities for that.

The goals of each entity in the SPOT market are:
1- forescast its energy consumption or production in order to reserve the correct amount in the SPOT MARKET and minimize cost of the differentce in the DISPATCH MARKET.
2- reserve the above energy energy at the best possible price by bidding in any of the 8 SUB-MARKETS in the SPOT MARKET.
3- Addionally or buy making a profit of purchase and sellinf

**CONSUMERS AND PRODUCERS**
- Both energy producers and consumers make bids in the same SPOT MARKETS.
- A consumer submits mainly purchase bids but can also submit selling bids if their forecast changed and they bought too much energy.

**RULES FOR EACH BID**
- submitted for a specific HOUR of a specific DAY
- include energy QUANTITY (MWh) 
- include min and max PRICE (â‚¬) willing to sell/purchase.
- single PURPOSE: either purchase or sell
- target one single MARKET and one single ZONE
- target an HOUR inside the interval of the used MARKET
- be submitted inside the Start and End time of the used MARKET
- ENTITIES can submit multiple BIDs for the same HOUR, MARKET, ZONE and PURPOSE.

**ACCEPTANCE OR REFUSAL OF BIDS**
- For each HOUR, MARKET and ZONE, the SYSTEM will intersect the purchase and sell cumulative curves of all ENTITIES.
- The PRICE of the BIDS at the intersection defined the AWARDED PRICE
- All purchase BIDS with BID PRICE above the AWARDED PRICE are accepted, others are refused.
- All sell BIDS with BID PRICE bellow the AWARDED PRICE are accepted, others are refused.

# Goals of the exercise

**GOAL 1: MAX & MIN PRICES**
- For each HOUR, DAY and ZONE, predict the MARKET with lower PRICE 
- For each HOUR, DAY and ZONE, predict the MARKET with higher PRICE 

**GOAL 2: BEST STRATEGY WITH 1X PURCHASE & 1X SELL**

RULES:
- For each HOUR, DAY and ZONE, purchase 1MWh in just one MARKET and sell 1MWh at another MARKET.
- Can be use any MARKETS in any order of PURSCHARE / SELL
- VALUE = PRICE SELL - PRICE PURCHASE
- VALUE is defined for each HOUR, DAY and ZONE
- GOD STRATEGY is the perfect strategy.
- GOD_RATIO = VALUE of the STRATEGY / VALUE of the GOD STRATEGY 
- To rank your Strategies use VALUE and GOD_RATIO

GOAL:
- Create a strategy that maximizes VALUE over an long period of time (several days)
